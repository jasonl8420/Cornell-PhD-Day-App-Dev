His research is in the fields of economics, finance and networks. In economics, he and Lawrence Blume work on learning and wealth dynamics. In finance, his work with Maureen O'Hara focuses on market microstructure and asset pricing. In networks, he works with colleagues in the Computer Science department on trading networks and network formation.\nProfessor Easley recently announced a new measure developed with Cornell colleague Maureen O’Hara and Marcos Lopez de Prado of Tudor Investment Corporation that may be useful in preventing a “flash crash” similar to what happened in May 2010 when the stock market briefly erased almost $1 trillion in value and plunged the Dow Jones Industrial Average into its biggest intraday fall ever. The new volume-synchronized probability of informed trading (VPIN) metric is based on the imbalance of trade relative to the total volume. It identifies flow toxicity, which has been the primary topic of Easley and O'Hara’s research over the last 20 years. \nProfessor Easley and Professor Jon Kleinberg, Computer Science at Cornell, recently co-authored Networks, Crowds and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World.  The book is based on the popular undergraduate course, Networks, which they developed at Cornell. It combines different scientific perspectives in its approach to understanding networks and behavior in networked environments. Drawing on ideas from economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics, the book describes the emerging field of study that is growing at the interface of all these areas, addressing fundamental questions about how the social, economic, and technological worlds are connected.",

After completing an Electrical Engineering degree with a major in artificial intelligence at the Ecole Supérieure d’Electricité, in Gif-sur-Yvette, France, he went on to do MS and PhD degrees at Stanford in Computer Science. He came to Cornell in 2009.\nThe overarching goal of Dr. Guimbretière's research is to bring the ease of use of pen and paper interactions to computer interfaces. Pen and paper are an  extremely versatile tool used extensively by knowledge workers when sketching new concepts, exploring a design space by quickly sketching several variations, brainstorming during a meeting, or simply proofreading  documents.  Pen and paper interactions are rapid, fluid, and almost transparent to the user. Unfortunately, work captured on paper is often difficult to transfer back into the digital world where powerful computational resources are accessible. Through my work, I have demonstrated that the ease of use of pen and paper interactions and access  to digital resources  can be smoothly bridged. Blending hardware prototypes, software implementations, and empirical evaluation, I have proposed novel  pen interfaces for a wide variety of digital surfaces, including: large wall-sized displays such as the Stanford Interactive Mural; portable notepad-sized systems such as tablet PCs; and digital pens such as the Anoto system which can record and process strokes made on a special pre-printed paper. My work  establishes a  unified framework for pen computing  applicable to mixed paper-digital settings  as well as  a wide variety  of future  digital  interactive surfaces such as “digital wall paper” or electronic paper (e-paper), an area I have been exploring since I moved to Cornell. My work has been mostly supported by grants from the NSF (about $2.5M in total including a CAREER award), has been published in first tier ACM conferences and journals, and had a significant impact (my H-index is 19).",

He’s also the former Chair of Information Science and Dean of William Keeton House.\nDr. Jackson teaches and conducts research in the areas of technology ethics, law and policy; maintenance, repair and sustainability; and technology, inequality and global development.  His work is shaped by ideas coming out of American pragmatism, critical theory, and science and technology studies, and methodological traditions coming out of sociology, anthropology, philosophy, history, media studies, and law, along with information science sub-fields like human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work.  He’s especially interested in places where new computing infrastructures and practices meet the social and material world, with implications for collaboration, sustainability, development, inequality, and new (and old) cultural practices, including in music and art.  He’s also interested in places where new computing practices meet unsettled legal and ethical terrains, and the processes by which these uncertainties get reduced, codified and normalized.  His research with students and collaborators has been supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (including an NSF CAREER award), the Social Science Research Council, Ford Foundation, Sloan Foundation, World Bank, Intel Research, Atkinson Center for Sustainability, and the Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council, and has received 6 best paper awards (and 12 honorable mentions) at leading venues in the computing and information science field.",

She is also interested in how data collection uniquely impacts, and is contested by, marginalized populations.\nDr. Levy is also a fellow at the Data and Society Research Institute in New York City. She holds a Ph.D. in Sociology from Princeton University and a J.D. from Indiana University Maurer School of Law. Dr. Levy previously served as a law clerk in the United States Federal Courts.",

His team has used data from Twitter and Spotify to track diurnal and seasonal mood changes across the globe, national telephone logs to measure the economic correlates of network structure, and both social media and phone logs to reveal social wormholes that create high-bandwidth connections across vast network distances.\nRecent research has focused on political polarization, including a study on why liberals drink lattes and how polarization extends even to the consumption of books on popular science.

His lab focuses on digital fabrication, a sub-field of technical human-computer interaction (HCI). Their goal is to enable personal fabrication, e.g., to make digital fabrication relevant to everyone as opposed to the industrialists and hobbyists who currently use fabrication machines. This requires the field to pivot by inventing new fabrication machines, design tools, interfaces for different groups of users, application contexts, mechanical education curricula, and more. During his Ph.D., Thijs focused on creating models for laser cutting that are machine-independent, and allow users to reproduce content shared online, and build on the work of others (aka portability). In the wake of this he implemented a suite of software systems and tools that together allowed high-school students to design and build fully functional western guitars using laser cutting, a small step towards this bigger goal. His work is published at top-tier conferences in HCI (ACM CHI and UIST).\nPreviously, Thijs was a Ph.D. student with Patrick Baudisch at the Hasso Plattner Institute, Germany. He worked as research assistant with Shengdong Zhao at the National University of Singapore. He holds a MSc in IT Product Design from the University of Southern Denmark and a BSc in Industrial Design from Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands.",
